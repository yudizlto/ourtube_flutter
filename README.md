```

### 2. Install dependencies

### 4. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your own keys:
```ini
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
API_BASE_URL=https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3

### 5. Firebase configuration
